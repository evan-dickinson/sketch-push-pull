Sketch driver fix-ups:

1) Create the tmp directory, if doesn't exist
2) Fix path to import header.cocoascript
3) Example is wrong; doesn't use promise api
4) Typo in the first example -- extra curly brace

5) Can't print log messages
  - Can the JSON go into a named pipe?


Bugs in the app:
* After push into group, would be nice to keep the item selected. 
  - In the layer list, open up the group you pushed into. See the item in its new home.
